===========


This interactive visual is made using publicly available data on the number of bikers crossing the Fremont bridge (hourly)
from October 2012 through January 2014.  

The visual is available here: http://cse512-14w.github.io/a3-mikefree/

Users should be able to ask questions like, how does the number of bikers change over time, on which days do most people bike, and which times are most popular for biking

The code is heavily adopted from this visualization: https://github.com/square/crossfilter/tree/gh-pages
